A German Shepherd, Labrador and Oscar all died and are standing in front of God.
God asks all three of them what they believe in.
The German Shepherd replies: "I believe in discipline, training, and loyalty to my owner."
"Good," says God, "take a seat on my left side."
"Labrador, what do you believe in?" Asks God. The Labrador answers: "I believe in fun, play, and loving my owner."
"Ah," God said, "You can come sit at my right side."
Then he looks at Oscar,  "And how about you?" Oscar  hops up on the throne, curls up in a little ball and says, "I believe you're in my seat!"
